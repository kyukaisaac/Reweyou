# Reweyou
Reweyou is a social news network. We're constantly examining, assessing and reviewing everything around us, consciously or subconsciously. We form opinions about the things we see, the events we witness, the stories we hear and the problems we face.
Reweyou empowers you to put all those reviews to use and bring about social change. You can give your views on a variety of topics ranging from governance, infrastructure and crime to health, sports and education. You can simply 'capture' reviews, in the form of a quick picture , and upload it on the app. You can also keep track of the latest reviews on similar topics in your city as well as share and second other people's reviews.

But that's not all. Every week, our team will analyze and create infographics of the reviews received during that week and send them to media houses and/or other concerned organisations. Your voice shall be heard.

Reweyou team believes in open-sourcing app code.
